About The Game:
Hand Cricket is usually a game played between two people or two groups of people. It is an emulation of real world cricket.
Since many of us could not play Cricket outside in the ground, all the time when we were young, we came up with the game hand cricket.
This game is widely popular among school Children in India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. It is played through hand gestures.
Each hand gesture signifies a number. Usually the numbers lie between one to six. Both the players (the bowler and the batsman), should make the gestures simultaneously.
If the numbers (which the hand gesture signifies) gestured by both the bowler and the batsman match, the batsman is out.
If not, then the number signified by the batsman's gesture gets added to his score. When one player gets out, their roles are switched.
So both players get to play as the batsman as well as the bowler. The score set by the first person is the target to be beaten by the second person.
Therefore the winner would be the person who is able to score the most. Just like in Cricket. Quite Simple.
The game here is an attempt to capture the same feeling of playing Hand Cricket through a computer, where the gestures are replaced with keyboard inputs (numbers).
